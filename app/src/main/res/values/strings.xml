    <string name="explain">Resistor values are an easy enough calculation. Resistors are almost
        always labeled with 4-6 coloured bands; the bands will have a large \'gap\' between them with
        3-4 bands on one side and 1-2 bands on the other. This gap shows us what the different bands
        mean.</string>
